# **Business Insights 360**

## **Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding company in the tech market, has embarked on its first data analytics journey using Power BI to outpace competitors and enhance decision-making across key areas like finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. This project aims to answer stakeholder questions, drive data-driven decisions, and deliver valuable insights.

I developed this project as part of the Codebasics Power BI course, which guided me through a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis process. You can find the course details [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project).

## **Key Questions for Project Kickoff**

- What is the objective of building this Power BI dashboard?
- How will the projectâ€™s success be measured?
- What are the expectations and concerns of stakeholders?
- Who will be using this dashboard, and for what purpose?
- What resources and data are needed?
- What can go wrong, and how can those risks be mitigated?

## **Dataset Understanding**

Having a deep understanding of available data is crucial before diving into analysis. The data used in this project includes:

- **Dimension Tables:** Contain static data such as customer and product details
- **Fact Tables:** Capture transactional data like sales and forecasts

### **Key Tables:**

- **dim_customer:** Information about 27 markets, 75 customers, sales platforms, and sales channels
- **dim_market:** Details of markets, regions, and sub-zones
- **dim_product:** Product categories and divisions
- **fact_forecast_monthly:** Forecast data to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize inventory
- **fact_sales_monthly:** Sales data with corresponding sold quantities
- **Additional Tables:** Include freight costs, manufacturing costs, and invoice deductions

## **Importing Data into Power BI**

Data was imported from MySQL, aligning with Power BI's data connectivity options. Ensuring a secure and accurate import process was key to maintaining data integrity.

## **Data Modeling**

Data modeling is the backbone of any successful Power BI project. I employed the Snowflake schema for this project, which provided a structured and efficient data foundation. Good practices in data modeling ensured optimal report performance.
